The moodify app is a Python-based application that analyzes music data to determine the mood of a track and provides personalized recommendations based on the user's mood. The application consists of three main scripts: `calculate_mood_score.py`, `training_model.py`, and `moodify_app.py`. This README provides information on each script and instructions for setting up and running the moodify app.

## Scripts

### `calculate_mood_score.py`

This script calculates a mood score based on audio features and assigns specific moods to each track. It also considers genre information and updates the mood labels accordingly.

### `training_model.py`

This script loads training and testing data, preprocesses it, trains a Decision Tree model, and evaluates the model's accuracy. It also adds the predicted mood to the testing data and saves the data with the predicted mood to a new CSV file.

### `moodify_app.py`

This script implements a Flask web application that allows users to input their mood and receive personalized music recommendations. It interacts with the Spotify API to create and download playlists.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Flask
- Spotipy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Bootstrap

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/moodify_app.git
   cd moodify_app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `calculate_mood_score.py` script to calculate mood scores and assign moods to tracks.

   ```bash
   python calculate_mood_score.py
   ```

2. Run the `training_model.py` script to train the Decision Tree model and generate predictions.

   ```bash
   python training_model.py
   ```

3. Run the `moodify_app.py` script to start the Flask web application.

   ```bash
   python moodify_app.py
   ```

4. Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) to access the moodify app.


## Known Issues and Bugs

# 1. Authorization Redirect Issue

**Description:**
Clicking the "Download" button is expected to redirect users to the Spotify login page for account authorization. However, there may be instances where the redirection does not occur as expected.

**Workaround:**
If you encounter this issue, please ensure you are not already logged in to Spotify. If the problem persists, try refreshing the page or opening the app in an incognito/private browsing window.

# 2. Playlist Description Display Issue

**Description:**
The playlist description may not always appear when downloading a playlist.

**Workaround:**
If the playlist description is missing, you can manually add the description when importing the playlist into your Spotify account.

# 3. Deployment Troubles and Requirements.txt

**Description:** 
There are difficulties deploying the application, and there might be issues with the `requirements.txt` file.

**Workaround:**
  - Double-check the contents of `requirements.txt` to ensure all necessary dependencies and versions are specified correctly.
  - Verify that your deployment environment is compatible with the specified dependencies.
  - Check for error messages during deployment

# 4. Favicon Not Showing Up

**Description:** The favicon specified in the `index.html` file may not be displayed.

**Workaround:** Verify the path and file format of the favicon. Ensure it is correctly referenced in the HTML file, and the file is accessible.
